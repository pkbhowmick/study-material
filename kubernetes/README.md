## Kubernetes Basic Interactive tutorial

Resource: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/

### Step #01 : Create a kubernetes cluster

- Install minikube from [here](https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/)
- ```$ minikube version``` [to check minikube is installed properly]
- ```$ minikube start``` [to run kubernetes cluster locally. Minikube started a VM and now a kubernetes cluster is running in that VM]
- Install kubectl from [here](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/). kubectl is kubernetes command line interface which uses the kubernetes API to interact with the cluster.
- ```$ kubectl version``` [to check kubectl is installed properly]
- ```$ kubectl cluster-info``` [to view the cluster details]
- ```$ kubectl get nodes``` [to view the nodes in the cluster]

### Step #02 : Deploy an app

- ```$ kubectl create deployment <deployment_name> --image=<image_location>``` Note: Include the full repository url for images outside Docker hub.
- ```$ kubectl create deployment go-api-server --image=pkbhowmick/go-rest-api:latest``` [to deploy go-rest-api image in kubernetes]
- ```$ kubectl get deployments``` [to see the list of all deployments]
- ```$ kubectl proxy``` Note: Pods running inside kubernetes running on a private, isolated network and by default they are visible within the same kubernetes cluster. kubectl command can create a proxy that will provide API endpoint to communicate with our application.

### Step #03 : Explore the app

- ```$ kubectl get pods``` [to see the existing pods]
- ```$ kubectl describe pods``` [to view what containers are inside that Pod and what images are used to build those containers]
- ```$ kubectl logs $POD_NAME``` [to view the logs of the pod]
- ```$ kubectl exec $POD_NAME env``` [to view the list of environment variables of the pod]
- ```$ kubectl exec -ti $POD_NAME sh``` [to start a shell session inside the pod]

### Step #04 : Expose the app publicly

- ```$ kubectl get services``` [to see the list of services] Note: Although each Pod has a unique IP address, those IPs are not exposed outside the cluster without a Service. Services allow your applications to receive traffic.
- ```$ kubectl expose deployment/go-api-server --type="NodePort" --port=8080``` Note: We have a Service called kubernetes that is created by default when minikube starts the cluster. To create a new service and expose it to external traffic weâ€™ll use the expose command with NodePort as parameter
- ```$ kubectl describe services/go-rest-api``` [To find out what port was opened externally (by the NodePort option)]
- ```$ export NODE_PORT=$(kubectl get services/go-api-server -o go-template='{{(index .spec.ports 0).nodePort}}')``` [Create an environment variable called NODE_PORT that has the value of the Node port assigned]
- ```$ echo NODE_PORT```
- ```$ curl --user admin:demo $(minikube ip):$NODE_PORT/api/users``` Note: Now APIs are accessible publicly by nodeport and minikube ip

### Step #05 : Scale up the app

- ```$ kubectl get rs``` [To see the ReplicaSet created by the Deployment]
- ```$ kubectl scale deployments/go-api-server --replicas=4``` [To scale up we'll use the kubectl scale command, followed by the deployment type, name and desired number of instances]

## Kubernetes Basic Architecture

### Master node

- API server
- Scheduler
- Controller manager
- ETCD
  
### Worker node

- kubelet
- kube-proxy
- pod
- container runtime


## Kubernetes Object Management 

- Imperative commands
- Imperative object configuration
- Declarative object configuration

## Namespaces

### Kubernetes starts with four initial namespaces.
- default (default namespace)
- kube-system (used by the kubernetes system)
- kube-public (publicly available namespaces)
- kube-node-lease (heartbeat of the cluster)

### Use cases when to use namespaces:

- structure components
- avoid conflicts between teams
- share services between different environments
- access and resource limit on namespace level

## Labels and selectors

- Labels are key/value pairs that area attached to objects, such as pods.
- Via a label selector, the client/user can identify a set of objects. The label selector is the core grouping primitive in Kubernetes.

## Field Selectors

- Field selectors let you select Kubernetes resources based on the value of one or more resource fields. like:

```$ kubectl get pods --field-selector status.phase=Running```
  
## Cluster Architecture
### Node
- A node may be a virtual or physical machine, depending on the cluster. Each node contains the services necessary to run Pods, managed by the control plane.
- The components on a node include the kubelet, a container runtime, and the kube-proxy.

### Node controller
The node controller is a Kubernetes control plane component that manages various aspects of nodes.
The node controller has multiple roles:
- Assigning a CIDR block to the node
- Keeping the node controller's internal list of nodes up to date.
- Monitoring the node's health

## Control Plane - Node Communication
### Node to Control Plane(API Server)

- Kubernetes has a "hub-and-spoke" API pattern. All API usage from nodes terminate at the apiserver.
- The apiserver is configured to listen for remote connections on a secure HTTPS port (typically 443) with one or more forms of client authentication enabled. 

### Control Plane to Node

- apiserver to kubelet: The connection from apiserver to kubelet are used for:
    - Fetching logs for pods 
    - Attching to running pods
    - Providing the kubelet's port-forwarding functionality
- apiserver to nodes, pods, and services: The connections from the apiserver to a node, pod, or service default to plain HTTP connections and are therefore neither authenticated nor encrypted. These connections are not currently safe to run over untrusted and/or public networks.

### SSH tunnels

- Kubernetes supports SSH tunnels to protect the control plane to nodes communication paths.
- This tunnel ensures that the traffic is not exposed outside the network in which the nodes are running.
- SSH tunnels are currently deprecated, and the konnectivity service is a replacement for this communication channel

### Konnectivity service

- As a replacement to the SSH tunnels, the Konnectivity service provides TCP level proxy for the control plane to cluster communication.
- The Konnectivity service consists of two parts: the Konnectivity server and the Konnectivity agents, running in the control plane network and the nodes network respectively. 

## Controllers
In Kubernetes, controllers are control loops that watch the state of your cluster, then make or request changes where needed. Each controller tries to move the current cluster state closer to the desired state.

- Control via API server: The Job controller is an example of a Kubernetes built-in controller. Built-in controllers manage state by interacting with the cluster API server.
- Direct control: By contrast with Job, some controllers need to make changes to things outside of your cluster.

## Cloud Controller Manager
The cloud-controller-manager is a Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that just interact with your cluster.

### Cloud controller manager functions

- Node controller: The node controller is responsible for creating Node objects when new servers are created in your cloud infrastructure.
- Route controller: The route controller is responsible for configuring routes in the cloud appropriately so that containers on different nodes in your Kubernetes cluster can communicate with each other.
- Service controller: Services integrate with cloud infrastructure components such as managed load balancers, IP addresses, network packet filtering, and target health checking.

## Containers
- Each container that we run is repeatable means that you get the same behavior wherever we run it. 
- A container image is a ready-to-run software package, containing everything needed to run an application.
- The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers. Kubernetes supports several container runtimes: Docker, containerd, CRI-O or any implementation of the Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface).

### Images

- A container image represents binary data that encapsulate an application and all its software dependencies.
- Updating images: The default pull policy is IfNotPresent which causes the Kubelet to skip pulling an image if it already exist. We can use imagePullPolicy of the container to *Always* to always force a pull.
- Configure nodes to authenticate to a private registry: We can copy our local .docker/config.json(which already has auth key for docker hub) file to every node like root@"$n":/var/lib/kubelet/config.json. After that kubelet will use that config file for pulling image from a private registry.
- Usecases:
   - Cluster running only open-source images. No need to hide images.
   - Cluster running some proprietary images which should be hidden to those outside the company, but visible to all cluster users.
   - Cluster with proprietary images, a few of which require stricter access control.
   - A multi-tenant cluster where each tenant needs own private registry.
  
### Container Environment
The Kubernetes Container environment provides several important resources to Containers:

- A filesystem, which is a combination of an image and one or more volumes.
- Information about the Container itself.
- Information about other objects in the cluster.

### Runtime Class
RuntimeClass is a feature for selecting the container runtime configuration. The container runtime configuration is used to run a Pod's containers.
RuntimeClass can be setup in two ways:
- Configure the CRI implementation on nodes
- Create the corresponding RuntimeClass resources

### Container Lifecycle Hooks
The hooks enable Containers to be aware of events in their management lifecycle and run code implemented in a handler when the corresponding lifecycle hook is executed.

There are two hooks that are exposed to Containers:
- PostStart: This hook is executed immediately after a container is created.
- PreStop: This hook is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness probe failure, preemption, resource contention and others.

Hook handler implementations: Containers can access a hook by implementing and registering a handler for that hook. There are two types of hook handlers that can be implemented for Containers:
- Exec: Execute a specific command
- HTTP: Execute an HTTP request 

Hook handler execution: 
- When a Container lifecycle management hook is called, the Kubernetes management system execute the handler according to the hook action, exec and tcpSocket are executed in the container, and httpGet is executed by the kubelet process.
- Hook handler calls are synchronous.
- Hook delivery is guaranteed.

## Workloads(Pods)
A workload is an application running on Kubernetes. Kubernetes provides several built-in workload resources:
- Deployment and ReplicaSet
- StatefulSet
- DaemonSet
- Job and CronJob
### Pods
Pods are the smallest deployable units of computing that you can create and manage in Kubernetes.

A Pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod) is a group of one or more containers, with shared storage/network resources, and a specification for how to run the containers.

Pods in a Kubernetes cluster are used in two main ways:
- Pods that run a single container
- Pods that run multiple containers that need to work together

Here are some examples of workload resources that manage one or more pods:
- Deployment
- StatefulSet
- DaemonSet

Pod templates: The sample below is a manifest for a simple Job with a template that starts one container. The container in that Pod prints a message then pauses.
```
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  template:
    # This is the pod template
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: hello
        image: busybox
        command: ['sh', '-c', 'echo "Hello, Kubernetes!" && sleep 3600']
      restartPolicy: OnFailure
    # The pod template ends here
```

### Pod Lifecycle
Pods follow a defined lifecycle, starting in the Pending phase, moving through Running if at least one of its primary containers starts OK, and then through either the Succeeded or Failed phases depending on whether any container in the Pod terminated in failure.

### Init Containers
During Pod startup, the kubelet delays running init containers until the networking and storage are ready. Then the kubelet runs the Pod's init containers in the order they appear in the Pod's spec.

Each init container must exit successfully before the next container starts. If a container fails to start due to the runtime or exits with failure, it is retried according to the Pod restartPolicy.

### Pod Topology Spread Constraints
Topology spread constraints can be used to control how Pods are spread across the cluster among failure-domains such as regions, zones, nodes, and other user-defined topology domains. This can help to achieve high availability as well as efficient resource utilization.

### Ephemeral Containers
Ephemeral Containers is a special type of container that runs temporarily in an existing Pod to accomplish user-initiated actions such as troubleshooting.

## Workloads(Resources)

### Deployments
A Deployment provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets.

#### Creating a deployment
Creating a deployment for [go-rest-api](https://github.com/pkbhowmick/go-rest-api) server.

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: api-server-deployment
  labels:
    app: go-rest-api
spec:
  replicas: 2
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: go-rest-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-rest-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: go-rest-api
          image: pkbhowmick/go-rest-api:latest
          ports:
            - containerPort: 8080
```
**Note**:
You must specify an appropriate selector and Pod template labels in a Deployment (in this case, app: go-rest-api).

Do not overlap labels or selectors with other controllers (including other Deployments and StatefulSets). Kubernetes doesn't stop you from overlapping, and if multiple controllers have overlapping selectors those controllers might conflict and behave unexpectedly.

#### Updating a deployment
**Note**: A Deployment's rollout is triggered if and only if the Deployment's Pod template (that is, .spec.template) is changed, for example if the labels or container images of the template are updated. Other updates, such as scaling the Deployment, do not trigger a rollout.

To update image:
```shell
$ kubectl set image deployment/api-server-deployment go-rest-api=pkbhowmick/go-rest-api:1.0 --record
```
To edit deployment:
```shell
$ kubectl edit deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment
```
- Label selector updates: It is generally discouraged to make label selector updates and it is suggested to plan your selectors up front.
  
**Note:** In API version apps/v1, a deployment's label selector is immutable after it gets created.

#### Rolling back a deployment:
To check the revisions of the Deployment:
```shell
$ kubectl rollout history deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment
```
To rollback to the previous revision:
```shell
kubectl rollout undo deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment --to-revision=<revision number>(optional flag)
```

#### Scaling a deployment
To scale a deployment:
```shell
kubectl scale deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment --replicas=4
```
To auto scale based on cpu utilization:
```shell
kubectl autoscale deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment --min=2 --max=5 --cpu-percent=80
```

#### Pausing and Resuming a Deployment
We can pause a deployment before triggering one or more updates and then resume it. This allows multiple fixes in between pausing and resuming without triggering unnecessary rollouts.
To pause the deployment:
```shell
kubectl rollout pause deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment
```
To resume the deployment:
```shell
kubectl rollout resume deployment.v1.apps/api-server-deployment
```

### ReplicaSet
A ReplicaSet's purpose is to maintain a stable set of replica Pods running at any given time. But it is recommended to use Deployment instead of ReplicaSet.

#### Deploy the go-rest-api server using ReplicaSet
First let's write the manifest file replicaSet.yaml for ReplicaSet

```
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: ReplicaSet
metadata:
  name: go-rest-api-rs
  labels:
    app: go-rest-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: go-rest-api
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: go-rest-api
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: go-rest-api
          image: pkbhowmick/go-rest-api
          ports:
          - containerPort: 8080

```

### StatefulSets
StatefulSet is the workload API object to manage stateful applications like databases.

Unlike a Deployment, a StatefulSet maintains a sticky identity for each of thier Pods. These pods are created from the same spec, but are not interchangeable. 

### DaemonSet
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) Nodes run a copy of a Pod. 
Some typical uses of a DaemonSet are:
- running a cluster storage daemon on every node
- running a logs collection daemon on every node
- running a node monitoring daemon on every node

#### Create a DaemonSet
```shell
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: dm-test
  labels:
    k8s-app: logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: dmSet-pod
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: dmSet-pod
    spec:
      containers:
        - name: fluentd
          image: quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2
```

### Jobs
A Job creates one or more Pods and ensures that a specified number of them successfully terminate.

#### Running an example job
```shell
apiVersion: batch/v1
kind: Job
metadata:
  name: pi
spec:
  ttlSecondsAfterFinished: 15
  template:
    metadata:
      name: pi
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: pi
        image: perl
        command: ["perl", "-Mbignum=bpi", "-wle", "print bpi(10)"]
      restartPolicy: Never
  backoffLimit: 4
```

### Garbage Collection
The role of the Kubernetes garbage collector is to delete certain objects that once had an owner, but no longer have an owner.


### Replication Controller
A ReplicationController ensures that a specified number of pod replicas are running at any one time. In other words, a ReplicationController makes sure that a pod or a homogeneous set of pods is always up and available.

#### Deploy API server using Replication Controller
First write the manifest file ReplicationController.yaml for replication controller
```shell
# ReplicationController.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ReplicationController
metadata:
  name: api-server-rc
  label:
    app: go-rest-api
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
   app: go-rest-api
  template:
    metadata:
      name: go-rest-api-pod
      labels:
        app: go-rest-api
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: go-rest-api
        image: pkbhowmick/go-rest-api
        ports:
        - containerPort: 8080
```

Let's attach it to a service to access it from outside world.
```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: api-server-service
spec:
  type: NodePort
  selector:
    app: go-rest-api
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 8080
      targetPort: 8080
      nodePort: 30000
```
Now let's apply the yaml files using kubectl apply command.

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f ReplicationController.yaml
replicationcontroller/api-server-rc created
$ kubectl apply -f service.yaml
service/api-server-service created
```
Now the API server will be accessible from kind_node_ip:node_port

To clean up things used so far:
```shell
$ kubectl delete -f service.yaml
service "api-server-service" deleted
$ kubectl delete -f ReplicationController.yaml
replicationcontroller "api-server-rc" deleted
```

### CronJob
CronJobs are useful for creating periodic and recurring tasks, like running backups or sending emails. CronJobs can also schedule individual tasks for a specific time, such as scheduling a Job for when your cluster is likely to be idle.

A sample manifest file to run a CronJob:
```
apiVersion: batch/v1beta1
kind: CronJob
metadata:
  name: hello
spec:
  schedule: "*/5 * * * *"  # print date and hello in every five minutes
  jobTemplate:
    spec:
      template:
        spec:
          containers:
          - name: hello
            image: busybox
            args:
            - /bin/sh
            - -c
            - date; echo hello from kubernetes cluster
          restartPolicy: OnFailure
```
To see CronJob status
```shell
$ kubectl get cj
NAME    SCHEDULE      SUSPEND   ACTIVE   LAST SCHEDULE   AGE
hello   */5 * * * *   False     0        <none>          62s
```

#### CronJob Schedule Syntax
```
# â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ minute (0 - 59)
# â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ hour (0 - 23)
# â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the month (1 - 31)
# â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ month (1 - 12)
# â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”Œâ”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€â”€ day of the week (0 - 6) (Sunday to Saturday;
# â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚                                   7 is also Sunday on some systems)
# â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
# â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚ â”‚
# * * * * *
```
To generate CronJob schedule expressions, you can also use web tools like [crontab.guru](https://crontab.guru)

#### CronJob limitation
- Sometimes the number of jobs creation can't be controlled by CronJob. So, the job should be idempotent.
- The CronJob is only responsible for creating Jobs that match its schedule, and the Job in turn is responsible for the management of the Pods it represents.

## Services, Load Balancing, and Networking

### Service
A Kubernetes Service is an abstraction which defines a logical set of Pods running somewhere in the cluster, that all provide the same functionality. When created, each Service is assigned a unique IP address (also called clusterIP). This address is tied to the lifespan of the Service, and will not change while the Service is alive. Pods can be configured to talk to the Service, and know that communication to the Service will be automatically load-balanced out to some pod that is a member of the Service.


### Service Topology
Service Topology enables a service to route traffic based upon the Node topology of the cluster. For example, a service can specify that traffic be preferentially routed to endpoints that are on the same Node as the client, or in the same availability zone.


### DNS for Services and Pods

### Connecting Applications with Services
Kubernetes pods can communicate with each other pods, regardless of which host they land on. Kubernetes gives each pod its own cluster-private IP address. So conatainers within a pod can reach others ports on localhost, and all pods in a cluster can see each other without NAT(Network Address Translation).

#### DNS
Kubernetes offers a DNS cluster addon Service that automatically assigns dns names to other Services. To show this:
```shell
$ kubectl get svc kube-dns --namespace=kube-system
NAME       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP   EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)                  AGE
kube-dns   ClusterIP   10.96.0.10   <none>        53/UDP,53/TCP,9153/TCP   7d19h
```

#### Securing the Service

### EndpointSlices
EndpointSlices provide a simple way to track network endpoints within a Kubernetes cluster. They offer a more scalable and extensible alternative to Endpoints.

### Ingress
Ingress exposes HTTP and HTTPS routes from outside the cluster to services within the cluster. Traffic routing is controlled by rules defined on the Ingress resource.

Ingress config file to run the previously built API server service:
```shell
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: api-server-ingress
spec:
  rules:
  - host: api.github.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: api-server-service
            port:
              number: 8080
```

#### Simple fanout
A fanout configuration routes traffic from a single IP address to more than one Service, based on the HTTP URI being requested. An Ingress allows to keep the number of load balancers down to a minimum.

### Ingress Controller

### Network Policies
NetworkPolicies are an application-centric construct which allow us to specify how a pod is allowed to communicate with various network "entities" over the network.

#### Isolated and Non-Isolated Pods
By default, pods are non-isolated; they accept traffic from any source. Once there is any NetworkPolicy in a namespace selecting a particular pod, that pod will reject any connections that are not allowed by any NetworkPolicy.

#### Policy types
Each NetworkPolicy includes a policyTypes list which may include either Ingress, Egress, or both. 
- ingress: Allow/Deny incoming traffic
- egress: Allow/Deny outgoing traffic

### Adding entries to Pod /etc/hosts with HostAliases
Adding entries to a Pod's /etc/hosts file provides Pod-level override of hostname resolution when DNS and other options are not applicable. You can add these custom entries with the HostAliases field in PodSpec.

Modification not using HostAliases is not suggested because the file is managed by the kubelet and can be overwritten on during Pod creation/restart.

A Sample hostaliases-pod example:
```shell
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: hostaliases-pod
spec:
  restartPolicy: Never
  hostAliases:
  - ip: "127.0.0.1"
    hostnames:
    - "foo.local"
    - "bar.local"
  - ip: "10.1.2.3"
    hostnames:
    - "foo.remote"
    - "bar.remote"
  containers:
  - name: cat-hosts
    image: busybox
    command:
    - cat
    args:
    - "/etc/hosts"
```
Note: The kubelet manages the hosts file for each container of the Pod to prevent Docker from modifying the file after the containers have already been started.

### IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack
IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack enables the allocation of both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses to Pods and Services.

If IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack networking is enabled, the cluster will support the simultaneous assignment of both Ipv4 and Ipv6 addresses.
